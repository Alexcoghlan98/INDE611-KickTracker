# INDE611-KickTracker
This is my final year university project. It is a tracker that fits inside of a football boot and will track different aspects of a player’s game.
Data is huge in sport nowadays and especially football, there are many different jobs that revolve around data collection and they influence the way that a team play week in week out. Whether that be studying their own teams’ performance or looking at other teams and how they play and how they can counteract opposition plays.

I believe that lower league teams and grassroots level teams don’t have the systems available or finances in order to have the same infrastructure in order to report statistics like the bigger clubs in the world do. 
So, for my project I have decided to research, design, and develop a small tracker that will inside a player’s football boot and will track different aspects of that players game.
The four aspects it will track are:
-	Heart Rate
-	Number of steps in training/in a match
-	The amount of power a user creates when they are kicking a ball
-	The average speed of the player throughout a match

Once the user has completed their training session or match and they want to see how well they performed then they will be able to link their tracker to a web app that I am creating, and it will show them how they have got on. It will also log their previous performances so that they can look back and review if they are improving their overall game and if they aren’t then they will be able to understand what they need to do to build on their performances and become an overall better player.
